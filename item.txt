optimal algorithm sequence

-checks if the cell is empty
-adds it in the sequence if so
-when it is full, check if the number is contained in the array
-if it is available, then go to the next
-if not, then check the next algorithms which page is not used in the future
-replace that shit
-if no pages that can be used in the future, go fifo


issues encountered
<<<<<<< HEAD
-familiarization of c# > yt and google
-when declaring a placeholder object, nahahawak yung original graph > adding new to FrameCheck
-application of fifo at the end > converted it to list instead of queue and added check after the for loop
-usage of float points
=======
-familiarization of c#
-the system only recognizing one string in the regex counter
-when declaring a placeholder object, add new or else nahahawak yung original graph
-application of fifo at the end
-used regex to make page-reference string... so had to do the random shit
